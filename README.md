Overview
The Traffic Management Dashboard is a comprehensive solution designed to optimize traffic flow, predict future traffic conditions, and visualize congestion patterns. This project encompasses three main components:

Traffic Signal Management: An AI-powered system that manages traffic signals based on real-time traffic data, ensuring smooth flow and reduced wait times.
Future Traffic Prediction Model: A predictive model that forecasts traffic patterns, helping in planning and management of road usage.
Visualizer: A tool that provides a graphical representation of congested timings throughout the day for specific routes, allowing users to identify peak traffic times.
Additionally, the dashboard features an Optimal Route Tracker that analyzes real-time data to suggest the best routes, minimizing delays and improving travel efficiency.

Key Features
Dynamic Traffic Signal Management: Adjusts traffic signals in real time based on traffic conditions.
AI Traffic Prediction: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict future traffic conditions based on historical data and trends.
Congestion Visualization: Provides insights into congestion patterns, helping users plan their journeys better.
Optimal Route Tracking: Recommends the fastest routes based on live traffic data.
Role of APIs
APIs play a pivotal role in this project, facilitating the integration of real-time data from various sources. Specifically, we leverage:

Google Maps API: Used to fetch real-time traffic conditions, directions, and route optimization. The API enables the system to gather essential traffic data to inform the traffic signal management and optimal route tracking components.
Other Traffic APIs: Additional APIs may be used to gather supplementary traffic information and enhance the accuracy of predictions.
Cloud Services
The project utilizes cloud services to ensure scalability, reliability, and performance:

Cloud Hosting: The dashboard and backend services are hosted on cloud platforms, providing high availability and access from anywhere.
Data Storage: Cloud storage solutions are used to manage and store historical traffic data and AI models, enabling efficient data retrieval and management.
AI Model Deployment: The traffic prediction AI model is deployed on cloud infrastructure, allowing it to process large datasets and provide predictions in real-time.
